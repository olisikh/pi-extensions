# 🧠 pi-lsp — Run Targeted LSP Diagnostics and Fixes

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-lsp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-lsp) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

Give Pi targeted Language Server Protocol diagnostics and source fixes without running a full-project check for every intermediate edit.

Configure any language server by command and file extension instead of using hard-coded language families.

## ✨ Features

- Configures language servers in JSON and routes files by extension.
- Runs multiple servers for the same file type when complementary diagnostics are useful.
- Exposes `lsp_diagnostics` for exact ranges and `lsp_fix` for supported source actions.
- Supports workspace roots, bounded discovery, per-call server overrides, and preview-or-write edits.
- Starts servers only for tool calls, shuts them down afterward, and shows activity only while they run.

## 🎯 When to use pi-lsp

Use pi-lsp when an LSP can answer a targeted question about the files being edited faster than the project's authoritative validation commands.
It is most useful when:

- a full-project lint or typecheck is slow, but only a few files need intermediate feedback;
- structured diagnostics with exact ranges and severity are easier to act on than CLI output;
- a language server provides a useful source action such as `source.fixAll` or `source.organizeImports`;
- a multi-language repository benefits from one configurable interface for targeted diagnostics.

For most repositories, first document the authoritative format, lint, typecheck, build, and test commands in `AGENTS.md`, then enforce them with pre-commit hooks or CI where appropriate.
If those commands are already fast and reliable, pi-lsp may add little value.

A practical workflow is:

1. Use `lsp_diagnostics` during an edit only when targeted feedback is useful.
2. Optionally use `lsp_fix` for a supported server-provided source action.
3. Before considering the task complete, run the repository's authoritative validation commands.
4. Treat pre-commit hooks and CI as the final enforcement layer.

### Current limitations

- Diagnostics are not continuously injected into the conversation; the agent must call `lsp_diagnostics`.
- Language servers start and stop for each tool call, so pi-lsp does not retain an editor-like incremental session.
- The current tools expose diagnostics and source code actions, not symbol navigation, references, or semantic rename.
- A clean LSP result does not replace the project's formatter, linter, type checker, build, or tests.
- This project has not yet demonstrated through benchmarks that LSP improves agent task success, latency, or tool usage.

This outcome-first framing is informed by [Eric Traut's comment on LSP integration for coding agents](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/8745#issuecomment-3713058579).
The comment explains that the protocol was not designed specifically for coding agents and that repository-native checks may already provide much of the desired verification value.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-lsp
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-lsp
```

Build and try this package locally from the repository root:

```bash
npm --workspace @narumitw/pi-lsp run build
pi -e ./packages/pi-lsp
```

The package declares `dist/index.ts`, so an unbuilt local checkout must run the build before Pi loads the package directory.

## 🚀 Quick start

Install at least one supported language server on `PATH`, then run `/lsp` to inspect command availability.
The agent can call `lsp_diagnostics` for targeted diagnostics and `lsp_fix` for supported source actions.

## ⚙️ Settings

If no config is provided, pi-lsp ships a broad catalog of direct-command defaults.
Servers are started only when matching files are requested. pi-lsp does not download language servers, so install the commands you need and make them available on `PATH`.
During no-config diagnostics, unavailable default commands are filtered before workspace discovery.
If none can run, diagnostics completes successfully and reports the skipped servers.
Explicitly selected or custom-configured missing commands still report an error.

For example, install the Rust and Go servers with their official toolchains:

```bash
rustup component add rust-analyzer rust-src
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

Ensure the Go install directory (`$GOBIN` or `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`) is also on `PATH`.

Custom config is resolved in this order:

1. `<workspace>/.pi/pi-lsp.json`, only when Pi trusts the current project
2. `~/.pi/agent/pi-lsp.json`
3. the built-in server catalog

An untrusted project's canonical and legacy files are ignored.
A `root` passed to an LSP tool selects files and the server working directory; it does not grant that directory authority to provide project settings.
Project settings always come from the trusted Pi session workspace.

Compatibility: user-scoped `lsp.json` and trusted project-scoped `.pi/lsp.json` remain readable with a warning and are never modified automatically; rename them to their canonical `pi-lsp.json` names.
New paths take precedence when both names exist.

pi-lsp-specific environment settings have been removed.
Move their values into canonical JSON:

| Removed setting | JSON replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `PI_LSP_CONFIG` inline JSON | Save the same object as user `pi-lsp.json` or trusted project `.pi/pi-lsp.json` |
| `PI_LSP_CONFIG=/path/to/file.json` | Move or copy that configuration to one of the canonical paths above |
| `PI_<SERVER>_LSP_COMMAND` | Set the server's `command` to an argv array, with one string per executable or argument |

`servers[].env` remains supported because it configures the launched LSP child process rather than pi-lsp itself.

Providing custom config replaces the default server map.
The following `pi-lsp.json` example intentionally keeps five selected servers:

```json
{
  "ty": {
    "command": ["ty", "server"],
    "extensions": [".py", ".pyi"]
  },
  "ruff": {
    "command": ["ruff", "server"],
    "extensions": [".py", ".pyi"]
  },
  "biome": {
    "command": ["biome", "lsp-proxy"],
    "extensions": [
      ".astro",
      ".css",
      ".graphql",
      ".gql",
      ".html",
      ".js",
      ".jsx",
      ".json",
      ".jsonc",
      ".ts",
      ".tsx",
      ".vue"
    ]
  },
  "rust-analyzer": {
    "command": ["rust-analyzer"],
    "extensions": [".rs"],
    "pullDiagnosticsGraceMs": 5000
  },
  "gopls": {
    "command": ["gopls"],
    "extensions": [".go"]
  }
}
```

Use `servers` when you need global pi-lsp options such as timeout:

```json
{
  "timeout": 30000,
  "servers": {
    "ty": {
      "command": ["ty", "server"],
      "extensions": [".py", ".pyi"],
      "env": {
        "LSP_LOG": "debug"
      },
      "initialization": {
        "settings": {}
      },
      "skipDirectories": ["generated"]
    }
  }
}
```

Each server entry supports:

- `command`: argv array used to start the LSP server.
- `extensions`: file extensions that should route to this server.
- `env`: environment overrides for the LSP server process.
  The child inherits Pi's environment, then applies these values; an `env.PATH` value is also used to resolve `command[0]`.
- `initialization`: LSP initialization options and workspace configuration values.
- `skipDirectories`: additional directory names to exclude from recursive discovery.
  Explicitly requested paths remain available.
- `diagnosticsSettleMs`: positive number of milliseconds without another push-diagnostics publication before using the latest result.
  Defaults to `800`; the built-in intelephense route uses `4000`.
  The global timeout remains the upper bound.
- `pushDiagnosticsGraceMs`: positive number of milliseconds to wait for the first publication from a push-only server.
  It is unset by default, so a silent push-only server waits for the global timeout.
  The built-in Lua and Haskell routes use `3000`; Dart, Terraform, Gleam, and Tinymist use `2000`.
  This lets clean files finish after bounded silence without returning before a late error publication.
- `pullDiagnosticsGraceMs`: positive number of milliseconds to wait for a newer push publication after a server returns an empty pull-diagnostics result.
  It is unset by default; the built-in rust-analyzer route uses `5000` because initial workspace analysis can finish after an early empty pull response.

Global options:

- `timeout`: request timeout in milliseconds.
  Defaults to `20000`.

pi-lsp infers `languageId` from common extensions and falls back to the extension without the leading dot.

For example, run the configured Ruff server through the project's uv environment without shell-string parsing:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "ruff": {
      "command": ["uv", "run", "--no-sync", "ruff", "server"],
      "extensions": [".py", ".pyi"]
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚠️ Tool changes

`lsp_format` is no longer provided. pi-lsp now focuses on LSP diagnostics and source code actions:

- `lsp_diagnostics`
- `lsp_fix`

Use project formatters or shell commands for formatting workflows.

## 🛠️ Tools

### `lsp_diagnostics`

Run diagnostics through configured servers.

Parameters:

- `paths?`: files or directories to check.
  Defaults to the workspace root.
- `root?`: workspace root.
  Defaults to cwd.
- `limit?`: maximum files to open per selected server.
- `server?`: configured server name, or an array of names.
  Defaults to all matching servers.

### `lsp_fix`

Apply source fixes or import organization through a configured server that matches its extension.
If multiple servers match, pass `server` explicitly.

Parameters:

- `path`: file to fix.
- `root?`: workspace root.
  Defaults to cwd.
- `kind?`: source action kind.
  Defaults to `source.fixAll`.
- `write?`: write fixed text back to the file.
  Defaults to false.
- `server?`: optional configured server name.

## 💬 Commands

```text
/lsp
```

Shows configured LSP commands and whether each command is available on `PATH`.
