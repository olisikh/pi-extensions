# Async runtime protocol

This document defines `pi-subagents:completion-requirement:v1` and the current runtime boundary for final-answer-dependent detached work.

## Requirement identity

A caller marks one `subagent_spawn` or `subagent_send` turn with `completionRequirement: "required"`.
The runtime binds that requirement to the accepted `agentId`, executor-owned `runId`, and monotonically increasing turn generation.
Agent names and task paths are display and addressing aids and never replace exact run identity.
Omitting the field or using `background` preserves prior behavior and does not create a final-answer dependency.

## State ownership

`AgentRegistry` owns requirement transitions with the child turn and persisted completion outbox.
Tool-result `details.agent.completionRequirements` provides fork-sensitive branch evidence.
Session restoration retains exact requirements found on the active branch and treats sessions without visible subagent state as a possible compacted continuation.
The `context` hook owns one canonical hidden `pi-subagent-required-completions` block and replaces any older copy on every provider context assembly.
`CompletionDeliveryBroker` owns exact completion visibility acknowledgement and asks the registry to mark the corresponding requirement visible.
No timer, waiter, or UI object owns requirement truth.

## States

A newly accepted exact run enters `pending`.
A durably persisted terminal completion moves the exact run to `available` and records its completion ID and terminal child state.
Observation of that exact completion ID in the intended parent context moves the run to `visible`.
Interruption, close, restore of a non-running owner, or shutdown moves an unfinished requirement to `cancelled` with an explicit terminal state.
Duplicate completion delivery and acknowledgement are idempotent.
A follow-up receives a new run ID and generation and creates a requirement only when that follow-up explicitly requests one.
The runtime bounds retained requirement records per agent and rejects a sixty-fifth unresolved required run before acceptance so every unresolved exact identity fits in the canonical parent context.

## Parent behavior

Pending and available requirements remain final-answer dependencies.
Visible requirements no longer appear in the canonical context block.
Cancelled requirements are terminal and must be reported rather than silently treated as successful evidence.
A failed, partial, interrupted, stale, or cancelled child never satisfies mutating acceptance or independent-verification requirements merely because its turn settled.

## Budget termination

Omitted limits use runtime or agent policy and are recorded as runtime-sourced telemetry.
Explicit timeout, idle, turn, and tool-call limits remain compatible and are recorded as explicit sources.
A limit stop with non-empty successful bounded finalization becomes a typed `partial` outcome with the exact termination reason.
Empty finalization, failed finalization, malformed required structured output, and transport failures remain failed or contract-invalid.
Partial evidence is available to the parent but is not successful verification or mutating acceptance.

## Pi core boundary

The inspected supported Pi runtime emits provider `message_update` events before the TUI, RPC, JSON, and SDK surfaces display them.
An extension `message_end` handler can replace the finalized same-role message but cannot retract previously displayed deltas.
Steering is queued after the extension `input` event, direct RPC steering bypasses that event, and tool abort signals do not observe every accepted steer.
Therefore an extension cannot provide a hard pre-display final-answer barrier or a reliably steer-interruptible join across all supported modes.
`subagent_await` remains the bounded non-polling compatibility join and accurately states that queued steering is blocked until the tool settles.

A future core implementation would need replay-safe post-enqueue input activity, exact session-owned blocker handles, pre-display buffering or suppression, bounded timeout, and abort, replacement, reload, shutdown, and headless-mode semantics.
This repository does not modify or publish Pi core packages for this work.

## Codex reference

Codex `wait_agent` uses replay-safe pending activity plus an event-driven watch receiver for mailbox and steering activity.
Codex completion context uses a typed `FINAL_ANSWER` envelope with explicit task, sender, and payload fields.
Codex rollout budgets use shared runtime-owned accounting and acknowledge reminders only after context insertion.
These patterns inform waiting, completion identity, and budget ownership, but Codex also does not provide an absolute pre-display final-answer barrier.

## Compatibility fallback

Older persisted agents without requirement metadata behave as background work.
Current Pi versions continue using bounded persisted at-least-once completion delivery and optional idle-root auto-resume.
The package must not claim that prompt guidance, context injection, automatic delivery, or finalized-message replacement is a hard barrier.
The deprecated synchronous `subagent` tool remains available for unmatched chain, fan-in, panel, workflow, and compatibility callers.
