# 💬 pi-btw — Ask Side Questions Without Derailing the Main Task

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-btw)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-btw) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

Ask temporary questions in a separate side thread while the main Pi conversation and coding task stay focused.

Bring back only the answer or context you explicitly choose.

## ✨ Features

- Starts a fresh side thread immediately with `/btw <question>` or opens the manager with `/btw`.
- Uses any persisted main-session branch as context without switching that branch.
- Supports scrollable answers, follow-up questions, queued steering, and resumable in-memory threads.
- Keeps side questions and answers out of the main conversation by default.
- Brings back only the latest answer, a selected range, a question suffix, or the complete side thread when requested.
- Uses Pi's current model and thinking level or independent saved choices.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-btw
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-btw
```

Build and try this package locally from the repository root:

```bash
npm --workspace @narumitw/pi-btw run build
pi -e ./packages/pi-btw
```

The package declares `dist/index.ts`, so an unbuilt local checkout must run the build before Pi loads the package directory.

## 🚀 Quick start

Run `/btw <question>` to start a side thread immediately, or run `/btw` to choose context and settings first.
Side-thread questions and answers remain separate from the main conversation unless you explicitly bring selected context back.

## 💬 Commands

Open the pi-btw menu or provide the first question immediately:

```text
/btw
/btw <your side question>
```

Examples:

```text
/btw
/btw what does this TypeScript error mean?
/btw summarize the current implementation before we continue
/btw is this API name idiomatic?
```

Running `/btw` alone opens a menu with **Start side thread** selected first.
**Start from main thread tree…** opens Pi's native session tree and uses the root-to-selected-entry path, including the selected entry, as the new side thread's context.
Selecting context does not navigate, fork, append to, or switch the main conversation, and it preserves the main editor draft.
The selector is a snapshot of entries persisted when it opens, while the resulting side thread keeps an immutable context snapshot even if the main conversation later changes.
Press `Escape` to return to the `/btw` menu or `Ctrl+C` to close the flow.
The native tree controls remain available: copying reports success or failure, and an explicit `Shift+L` label edit persists through Pi as the only main-session mutation available from this selector.
When the current Pi session has non-empty side threads in memory, **Resume side thread** opens a bounded searchable choice list.
Search matches the displayed first question and question count while returning the thread's raw in-memory ID.
**Settings** changes the starting thinking level and whether shortcut changes for fixed levels are remembered.
Each Resume row keeps the first question as its fixed title, shows its question count, and the list is ordered by the newest recorded answer or visible error.
Opening and closing a thread without a new result does not reorder it.
`/btw <question>` bypasses this menu and always starts a fresh side thread.
Its answer opens above the side-thread editor.
The side thread uses a dedicated full-screen terminal view.
The main agent continues running in the background, but its screen rendering stays suspended until `/btw` closes, so new main-thread output cannot move a mouse selection inside the side thread.
Drag the primary mouse button across side-thread text to request a copy through Pi's host clipboard helper.
The view reports `Copied!` when Pi accepts the copy and `Copy failed` when Pi reports failure; actual clipboard availability still depends on operating-system and terminal support.
Returning from `/btw` redraws the main view with everything produced while it was hidden.
A compact `btw · side thread` header stays fixed above the content so the ephemeral workspace remains recognizable while scrolling.
Messages use Pi's normal user and assistant presentation without numbered turns or role labels.
Type each question and press `Enter`; no follow-up shortcut is required.
Press `Ctrl+Shift+F` to search completed or answering transcript content.
Press `Enter` or `Ctrl+G` for the next match, `Shift+Enter` or `Ctrl+Shift+G` for the previous match, and `Escape` to close search.
Search uses Pi's active theme, keeps the composer available after closing the search overlay, and does not include fixed header or footer chrome.
Previous side questions and answers remain available to the model and visible for that invocation.
The side-thread header shows its current thinking level.
Press Pi's configured `app.thinking.cycle` shortcut (`Shift+Tab` by default) in the composer to cycle the levels supported by the side-thread model; every later question uses the displayed level until it is changed again.
When a fixed thinking level is selected, each shortcut change is also written to `pi-btw.json` for the next invocation by default.
Turn **Remember thinking level changes** off in Settings to keep fixed-level changes local to the current side thread.
When **Same as main thread** is selected, shortcut changes are always local to the current side thread.
Neither path changes the main session's thinking level.
While a response is running, the transcript and composer remain visible above an `Answering…` status.
Type another question and press `Enter` to queue it as `Steering`; queued questions are shown in submission order and answered one at a time after the active response completes.
A queued question uses the side thread's thinking level when its turn begins.
A failed active response is shown in the transcript and does not discard later steering questions.
Use the mouse wheel or trackpad to scroll transcript history like Pi's main thread.
Keyboard `PgUp`/`PgDn` history navigation remains available and appears in the footer only when the transcript can scroll.
Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel the active response and discard the ephemeral side-thread draft and steering queue.
Completed questions, answers, and visible errors remain available through Resume until the current extension instance ends.
Steering remains entirely inside pi-btw and never appends to the main conversation or editor.

After at least one successful answer, press `Ctrl+R` to bring selected context to the main editor.
The scope menu shows the size of the latest question and answer and the entire side thread before you choose.
Bring the latest question and answer, everything from a chosen question onward, an exact text range, or the entire side thread.
Question-suffix, exact-range, and entire-thread choices preview the exact editable context block before the side thread closes.
Pressing `Escape` returns, while `Ctrl+C` closes without bringing anything to main.

The text-range selector supports both fast line selection and editor-style character selection.
It reports whether anything is selected plus the selected line, message, and approximate token counts.
Press `Space` to select the current raw source line, then use `Up`/`Down` to extend by whole lines; press `Space` again to clear it.
Alternatively, use the arrow keys to move the cursor and `Shift`+arrow keys to extend a character-level selection.
Starting a Shift selection replaces any active line selection.
Selected lines include a visible `●` marker in addition to highlighting.
Pi's configured keys control vertical navigation, bringing, and going back (`Up`/`Down`, `Enter`, and `Escape` by default), and the selector displays the active keys.
Selection follows raw source text rather than terminal-wrapped visual rows.

Bringing context to main closes the side thread and loads a deterministic, editable context block into Pi's main editor.
It never sends the draft automatically.
If the main editor already has a draft, append is the recommended default.
Replace is labeled as destructive and requires a second confirmation; Cancel returns to the side thread without changing either draft.
Concurrent editor updates made while these menus are open are preserved.
A success message reports whether context was loaded, appended, or replaced and its approximate size.
Without an explicit bring-to-main action, closing `/btw` never adds the side thread to the main conversation.
Non-empty threads remain only in memory for Resume within the current Pi session.
`/new`, Pi `/resume`, `/reload`, extension replacement, and process restart discard every retained thread.
Unsent drafts, steering queues, interrupted answers, and model credentials are never retained.

## ⚙️ Settings

By default, `/btw` uses the current session model.
To use an independent model for side questions, create:

```text
$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/pi-btw.json
```

The normal location is `~/.pi/agent/pi-btw.json`.
`PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is an existing Pi setting; pi-btw does not add any environment variables.

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5",
  "thinkingLevel": "low",
  "rememberThinkingLevelChanges": true
}
```

The `model` value uses `provider/model-id` format.
Only the first `/` is the separator, so model IDs may contain additional slashes, such as `openrouter/anthropic/claude-sonnet`.
The configured model must exist in Pi's model registry and have usable credentials.
If it cannot be found or authenticated, pi-btw warns and falls back to the current session model.
If neither model is available, `/btw` reports an error and stops.
This selection affects only `/btw`; it does not change the main session model.

Pi calls its reasoning setting the **thinking level**.
In Settings, choose **Same as main thread** to start each new side thread from the main thread's current thinking level.
This is stored by omitting `thinkingLevel` from `pi-btw.json`.

Set `thinkingLevel` only when you want a fixed pi-btw starting level.
Accepted fixed values are `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`.
The initial value and shortcut cycle are clamped to the selected side model's capabilities using Pi's model rules.
Resumed side threads keep their own local thinking level instead of re-syncing with the main thread.
Pi-btw does not read, write, or change the main session's `defaultThinkingLevel`.

`rememberThinkingLevelChanges` controls only persistence for fixed thinking levels and defaults to `true` when omitted.
A side-thread shortcut always changes that side thread immediately.
When a fixed thinking level is selected and remembering is on, the concrete level is written for the next invocation; when off, `pi-btw.json` stays unchanged.
When **Same as main thread** is selected, shortcut changes stay local even when remembering is on.
If a shortcut write fails, the local change remains active and pi-btw warns that it was not remembered.
A failed Settings-screen save instead restores the previous displayed value.

A missing settings file is a side-effect-free read: pi-btw creates it only after a Settings change or a remembered shortcut change.
Saves are ordered within the Pi process and published atomically with a same-directory temporary file and rename.
They preserve `model` and unknown fields; malformed or invalid files block saves and remain unchanged.
Settings must be valid UTF-8 and no larger than 64 KiB, so unexpectedly large or invalidly encoded files are rejected without being rewritten.
Separate Pi processes and external editors are outside this in-process ordering boundary.
The file is read for each `/btw` invocation, so edits apply without `/reload`.

## 🧠 Why use pi-btw?

Normal assistant messages become part of the main Pi conversation and can distract the coding agent from the task.
`pi-btw` creates a lightweight side channel for context-aware questions, making it useful for pair programming, debugging, code review, and repository exploration.
