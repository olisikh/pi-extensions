# 🔎 pi-github-pr — See Current Pull Request Status in Pi

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-github-pr)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-github-pr) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

See the current branch's GitHub pull request number, checks, review state, and discussion count directly in Pi's statusline.

The extension reads only PR metadata and remains passive, with no command, model tool, widget, or injected content.

## ✨ Features

- Shows compact PR number, checks, review state, and combined comment/review count.
- Starts the initial refresh in the background without delaying Pi startup.
- Refreshes once per minute and after agent turns.
- Uses GitHub CLI authentication and repository resolution without storing a token.
- Never reads or displays discussion bodies, review text, or review threads.
- Runs without commands, model tools, widgets, webhooks, or a separate service.

Example statusline text:

```text
PR #123: checks passing, approved, 7 comments
PR #123: checks failing (2), changes requested, 3 comments
PR #123: checks pending (5), commented, 12 comments
PR #123: no checks, draft, no comments
```

The check wording follows GitHub's Checks terminology.
The trailing comment count is the combined comments + reviews count.
When rendered by `pi-statusline`, the `github-pr` icon comes from pi-statusline icon settings.

## 📦 Install

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-github-pr
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-github-pr
```

Try this package locally from the repository root:

```bash
npm --workspace @narumitw/pi-github-pr run build
pi -e ./packages/pi-github-pr
```

An unbuilt local checkout must be built before loading the package directory.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Install and authenticate GitHub CLI yourself:

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
# For GitHub Enterprise Server (include the port if your URL uses one):
gh auth login --hostname github.example.com:8443
```

The extension shells out to `gh`; GitHub Enterprise hosts and credential storage are delegated to `gh`.
It uses the PR URL host (including any port) for follow-up API calls, so no manual `GH_HOST` is required.

## 🚀 Quick start

Start Pi inside a Git worktree after authenticating `gh`.
The extension automatically shows the current branch's pull request status and does not register a command or model tool.

## 💬 Behavior

The extension runs passively:

- On session start, it begins checking the current branch PR in the background and sets a compact statusline entry when the check completes.
- On Git branch change, it clears the old PR immediately and refreshes the new current branch.
- While the session remains open, it refreshes that same current branch PR every 60 seconds and after each agent turn.
- When an agent turn is aborted, it keeps the last successful PR status instead of treating cancellation as a GitHub failure.
- On branch change, session replacement, or session shutdown, it cancels the previous refresh timer and applicable in-flight initialization or refresh request.
- On session shutdown, it clears the statusline entry.
- If the directory has no GitHub PR, the statusline entry stays empty.
- If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, the statusline shows a short hint such as `PR gh missing` or `PR gh auth`.

## 🚧 Limitations

- Requires `gh`; there is no direct GitHub API, `GITHUB_TOKEN` fallback, or manual `GH_HOST` requirement.
- Only the current branch PR is shown; there is no command or tool for arbitrary PR lookup.
- Comment count uses `gh pr view` comments and reviews, not precise unresolved review-thread counts.
- It does not read PR comment bodies, review bodies, inline diff comments, or unresolved review-thread text.
- While a session is open, refresh runs every 60 seconds in addition to session start, branch changes, and agent turns; each refresh invokes `gh pr view` and one GraphQL count query.
