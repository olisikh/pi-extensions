# 🧭 pi-plan-mode — Plan Before Pi Edits Code

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-plan-mode)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-plan-mode) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

Explore a codebase, resolve important questions, and produce an implementation-ready plan before Pi is allowed to edit files.

This independently installable extension adds a Codex-like `/plan` collaboration mode that Pi core does not provide.

## ✨ Features

- Starts and manages Plan mode through `/plan`, `/plan start`, or `/plan <prompt>`.
- Defers Plan helper schemas until first use by default, then keeps the unlocked tool envelope stable while runtime policy blocks mutations and unsafe shell forms.
- Requires structured questions for important ambiguity and explicit completion for a decision-ready plan.
- Reviews the complete plan before implementation, export, save, continued planning, or discard.
- Starts implementation in the planning session or a fresh linked session with the exact approved plan.
- Persists Plan state and one saved plan across resume and compaction.
- Exposes statusline state and a configurable Plan tool allowlist, export destination, plan reinjection, shortcut, and thinking level.
- Cooperates anonymously with Workflow Mutex Protocol v1 participants so only one agent workflow starts in a session.

## 🔔 Mode events

Plan mode emits `pi:mode-changed` through Pi's existing `pi.events` bus whenever its semantic state changes.

The payload is a complete snapshot with `version: 1`, `source: "pi-plan-mode"`, `mode: "plan"`, `state`, and `active` fields.

Plan states are `off`, `active`, `ready`, `saved`, and `implementing`.

`active` is true for `active` and `ready`, and false for the retained or inactive states.

The extension emits an initial snapshot at `session_start` and an `off` snapshot when the session shuts down.

Events are live notifications and are not replayed, so consumers should subscribe during extension initialization and reset their state on session boundaries.

Consumers can ignore this event when they do not need Plan mode:

```ts
pi.events.on("pi:mode-changed", (event) => {
	if (!event || typeof event !== "object") return;
	const mode = event as {
		version?: unknown;
		source?: unknown;
		mode?: unknown;
		state?: unknown;
		active?: unknown;
	};
	if (mode.version !== 1 || mode.source !== "pi-plan-mode" || mode.mode !== "plan") return;
	// React to mode.state and mode.active.
});
```

The event contains no plan contents or other user-provided task data.

## 📦 Install

This release requires Pi 0.80.6 or newer.

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-plan-mode
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-plan-mode
```

Build and try this package locally from the repository root:

```bash
npm --workspace @narumitw/pi-plan-mode run build
pi -e ./packages/pi-plan-mode
```

The package declares `dist/index.ts`, so an unbuilt local checkout must run the build before Pi loads the package directory.

## 🚀 Quick start

Run `/plan` to open the state-aware menu, then start Plan mode and ask the agent to inspect and design the change.
Run `/plan <prompt>` when the first planning request is already known.

## 🧱 Cache-stable mode transitions

Plan and Normal requests share one append-only conversation.
The extension appends one hidden, model-visible, versioned Plan contract before the first Plan prompt and one Normal contract before the first post-Plan Normal or implementation prompt.
Ordinary linear turns do not rewrite or duplicate these contracts.
**Implement here** therefore retains the Plan dialogue, structured questions, assistant tool calls, completion evidence, and `Implement the plan.` kickoff in order.
**Start fresh and implement** remains the explicit isolation path and transfers only the approved plan plus the Normal mode contract to a linked session.

The `context` hook filters legacy repeated `plan-mode-context` artifacts but preserves current transition messages.
When compaction removes the effective physical transition, the hook inserts one canonical fallback at a deterministic retained-history boundary.
Repeated transforms leave that fallback in place instead of moving it to the newest turn.
An inactive legacy state entry alone does not inject a Normal contract, so sessions that never entered Plan mode keep their ordinary context after resume or reload.
Manual `/tree` navigation restores branch-owned Plan state and chooses the matching effective contract without navigating automatically or adding a branch summary.
Pi currently lists hidden custom transition messages in `/tree`; Plan mode rejects those internal targets, so select an adjacent conversation entry instead.

The default `toolVisibility: "after-first-plan"` keeps `plan_mode_question` and `plan_mode_complete` registered but inactive until the first successful Plan activation in an extension runtime.
That activation appends the two helpers in canonical order and may cause one provider-prefix cache miss because `/plan` is a slash-command transition rather than a model-called deferred-tool loader.
The helpers and their active-only prompt metadata remain visible after that boundary across off, exit, save, export, implementation, and same-runtime session starts.
Failed, cancelled, stale, or workflow-busy activation restores the exact prior active-tool list and does not consume the first-activation boundary.
Choose `toolVisibility: "always"` to expose both helpers at session startup and preserve the previous stable-prefix behavior from the first request.
Neither choice guarantees a cache hit because provider serialization, cache lifetime, minimum cacheable prefix, implementation details, and session affinity still control reuse.
A user, Pi, or another extension can change the active tool set outside this extension's guarantee.

The default `thinkingLevel: "inherit"` path also avoids a Plan-specific reasoning-parameter change.
Choosing a fixed Plan thinking level remains supported, but switching reasoning parameters can prevent provider-side state reuse even when system instructions and tool schemas are stable.

## 💬 Commands

```text
/plan
/plan start
/plan <prompt>
/plan tools
/plan show
/plan finalize
/plan implement
/plan save
/plan export [path]
/plan exit
```

In TUI and RPC, use bare `/plan` to open the menu for the current Plan state.
When Plan mode is off and no plan is stored, the launch menu shows the effective next-start tools and offers **Start Plan mode**, **Choose tools, then start…**, **Settings**, and **How Plan mode works**.
Settings edits the persistent defaults for later workflows.
Launch-menu policy changes remain a draft until **Done — start with this policy** is selected; Back, Escape, Ctrl+C, disposal, session replacement, and shutdown discard the draft without changing Plan state, active tools, thinking, or the stored selection.

Use `/plan start` when you want to enter Plan mode directly without sending a model message.
Use `/plan <prompt>` to enter Plan mode and immediately submit `<prompt>` as the first Plan-mode user message.
The exact argument `start` is reserved for direct activation; longer text such as `/plan start a migration` remains an inline planning prompt.
The extension does not register a startup flag; run `/plan start` after launch for direct activation.

Use **Choose tools, then start…** or the `/plan tools` compatibility shortcut to choose a session-specific Plan policy override before Planning starts.
Both routes use the same draft selector: **Done — start with this policy** stores the allowlist and starts the workflow, while cancellation leaves Plan mode off and changes nothing.
The bounded multi-select shows 10 rows at a time, supports viewport paging, descriptions, and explicit unavailable rows for blocked or currently inactive tools.
In TUI mode, type to fuzzy-search tool names, descriptions, policy, and source metadata; RPC keeps the complete unfiltered list.
Once Plan mode is active, tools are locked: `/plan` no longer offers tool or Settings actions, and `/plan tools` rejects the request.
Exit and start a new workflow if a different tool set is required.
The `plan_mode_question` tool keeps a dedicated model-requested questionnaire instead of using command-menu navigation.
`/plan show` displays the stored plan without starting a model turn, including the accepted plan while implementation is active.
`/plan finalize` explicitly asks the agent to complete the plan or ask one remaining material question, `/plan save` stores a completed ready plan for later and leaves Plan mode, and `/plan export [path]` writes a ready, saved, or active implementation plan to Markdown.
Completed and saved plan menus offer **Implement here**, which continues with the planning conversation, and **Start fresh and implement**, which opens a new session and transfers only the approved plan.
The direct `/plan implement` compatibility route remains equivalent to **Implement here** and never opens a selector.
A successful ready-plan export also leaves Plan mode; saved and active implementation exports retain their existing state.
`show`, `save`, `export`, and `implement` fail closed when no applicable plan is stored; `finalize` requires active Plan mode.
Pi executes extension commands immediately during streaming, but changing Plan state or handing off implementation during an active run would mix two mode contracts inside one run.
Plan mode therefore rejects busy start, exit, save, ready-plan export, implementation, state-changing menu action, and configured-shortcut transitions without changing state; wait for the run to settle and retry.
Prompts submitted while Plan mode is already active remain ordinary Plan follow-ups, and `/plan finalize` remains available as a Plan-preserving follow-up.
TUI and RPC show a warning for a rejected busy transition, while print and JSON routes throw an observable error.

`/plan export` uses the configured **Export destination**, which defaults to `PLAN.md`.
Supply a path to override that default for one export.
Relative paths resolve from the command's current `ctx.cwd` at export time, absolute paths remain absolute, a leading `@` is accepted for Pi path compatibility, and missing parent directories are created.
Explicit `/plan export <path>` input always wins over the setting.
Export never overwrites an existing file, directory, or symbolic link: choose another path or remove the existing target first.
A successful export adds one trailing newline but otherwise preserves the accepted Markdown exactly.
After a ready plan is written, Plan mode ends, its thinking level is restored, the current helper visibility is retained, and the ready state is cleared without starting a model turn.
Exporting a saved or active implementation plan leaves that state unchanged.
Failed or cancelled exports leave every Plan-mode state unchanged.
The resulting file is available to the agent through its normal file-reading tools.
Export is an explicit user-requested file mutation.
Model-initiated Plan-mode writes remain blocked.

In TUI and RPC, **Export plan…** opens a single-line path input from every ready, saved, or active plan menu.
The input shows both the configured value and its currently resolved path.
Submit an empty value to use the configured destination, or enter a relative or absolute one-off path.
A failed TUI export retains the draft for correction; RPC reopens its input dialog.
Escape returns to the owning menu without writing a file.
A successful ready-plan export closes the menu and ends Plan mode; saved and active implementation menus close without changing their stored state.

When Plan mode is active, ask the agent to design the change.
The agent may inspect files and run read-only commands, but it should not edit files or execute the implementation.
It should explore first, then use structured questions when your preference or a tradeoff materially changes the plan.
Configure persistent defaults or a one-workflow tool override before activation; Planning and ready menus deliberately keep those controls locked.

Plan mode registers `plan_mode_question` and `plan_mode_complete` during extension load.
With the default **After first plan** visibility, `session_start` leaves both helpers inactive until the first admitted Plan workflow appends them in that order.
With **Always**, `session_start` appends missing helpers in the same canonical order.
Once revealed, ordinary Plan transitions never remove them during that extension runtime.
By default, the Plan policy allows active safe built-ins such as `read`, limited `bash`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`.
Built-in `edit` and `write`, `update_plan`, inactive tools, and deselected tools are blocked at execution time even though active schemas remain visible.
Extension and custom tools are denied by default because Pi tools do not expose standardized mutability metadata; allow an already active custom tool before starting only when you accept the risk.
For example, you can opt into an active `firecrawl_scrape`, `firecrawl_search`, or `lsp_diagnostics` tool when you want to use it during planning.
After they become visible, the Plan-only helpers remain visible in Normal mode, but their handlers and the `tool_call` policy reject calls unless Plan mode owns the active workflow.

Limited `bash` uses a fail-closed policy, including when an extension overrides the canonical `bash` tool name.
It accepts common inspection commands, read-only Git and npm queries, pipelines and command lists composed entirely of accepted commands, plus selected checks such as `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, and `cargo test`.
It rejects output/input redirects, shell expansion, substitutions, subshells, background jobs, mutating flags, dependency changes, editors, and unknown commands.
A rejected parsed command list or pipeline identifies its first blocked command segment; malformed or unsupported shell syntax reports the complete submitted input instead.
Tests and builds may still write ignored caches or build artifacts and may execute project-defined hooks; enable or invoke them only when the repository is trusted.
This is extension-level risk reduction, not an OS sandbox.

`plan_mode_question` follows Codex's `request_user_input` pattern: the agent can ask 1-3 concise questions, each with meaningful options and a free-form Other path.
In TUI mode, a single question shows its header as plain muted text, submits as soon as its preset or custom answer is confirmed, and does not show tabs, Review, or question-navigation controls.
Add an optional note with `n` before confirming a single preset answer.
With two or three questions, one question appears at a time with question tabs and a final Review tab.
Use Tab, Shift+Tab, left, or right to visit any question or Review, including unanswered future questions.
Use up and down to choose an option, Enter to record it and advance, or `n` to record the highlighted option and open its optional note editor.
Press `n` again on an answered item to edit or clear its note.
Revisit a question to replace its answer; changing the chosen option clears its prior note.
Review lists every answer and note, blocks incomplete submission, and requires returning to a question to edit its answer or note.
Custom answers and notes retain their raw submitted text in the tool result, while terminal rendering is sanitized.
The TUI rejects either field above 4,000 characters instead of truncating it.
RPC keeps the existing sequential `select` and `editor` dialogs because Pi RPC cannot render custom TUI components.
If you cancel or no interactive UI is available, the agent should ask a concise plain-text question or proceed only with a clearly stated low-risk assumption instead of prematurely producing a final plan.

Pi identifies tools by tool name.
The pre-start selector stores accepted session policy names and shows each effective tool's source from Pi metadata, such as `built-in`, a user extension path, or a project extension path.
A selected name can run in Plan mode only when that effective tool was already active at session startup.
If an extension overrides a built-in tool with the same name, Pi exposes the effective tool for that name and the selector shows that source.

A complete Plan mode answer should appear only after the agent has resolved discoverable facts and high-impact user decisions.
The agent must call `plan_mode_complete({ plan })` alone as its final action, passing the complete Markdown plan.
The tool rejects empty or whitespace-only plans and plans longer than 50,000 JavaScript characters; it does not truncate.
Its visible result contains the full plan, and versioned result details let the extension restore it safely from the active session branch.

`plan_mode_complete` uses Pi's `terminate: true` hint.
Termination is best effort: if a model puts it in a parallel tool batch, Pi terminates the batch early only when every finalized sibling tool also terminates.
The prompt therefore requires the completion call to be standalone and last.
The extension deliberately does not infer completion from phrases such as “I will present the plan,” and ordinary research or clarification turns never trigger automatic retries.
`/plan finalize` and its exact canonical finalization prompt are explicit recovery requests.
If one of those requests ends normally without a valid structured question or completed plan, Plan mode waits for `agent_settled` and retries once with stronger tool guidance.
A valid question, accepted completion, user cancellation, explicit exit, workflow supersession, reload, session replacement, or shutdown cancels the retry.
A second prose-only failure leaves Plan mode active, warns in interactive modes, and requires another explicit `/plan finalize` request.

Legacy sessions and models may still submit one non-empty `<proposed_plan>` block with tags on their own lines.
That compatibility path remains accepted, but it is not the primary workflow.
Empty, malformed, unclosed, or multiple legacy blocks keep Plan mode active and produce a warning.

After completion, `/plan` opens the ready actions when interactive UI is available.
The same flat menu shows **Implement here** and **Start fresh and implement**, explains which conversation context each choice uses, and previews the selected **Plan reinjection** policy.
**Implement here**—and the compatibility route `/plan implement`—appends the Normal contract, lifts the Plan runtime policy, captures the reinjection setting, and starts implementation in the current session with its complete planning conversation and tool calls.
**Start fresh and implement** waits for the source session to become idle, verifies the selected model and authentication, creates a new session linked to the persisted source as its parent, and transfers the exact approved plan without copying planning messages, tool results, or compaction/branch summaries.
The destination still loads its normal `AGENTS.md`, skills, project resources, and extensions.
Choosing **Export plan…** asks for a destination, writes the plan, appends the Normal contract, restores inherited thinking, and leaves Plan mode without starting a model turn or changing active tools.
Choosing **Save for later**—or running `/plan save`—instead stores one plan in the current Pi session before leaving Plan mode.

When a resumed active Plan workflow completes before `/plan` has run in that resumed session, the automatic menu cannot obtain Pi's command-only session replacement capability; choosing fresh asks you to reopen `/plan`, where the same action is available.
A successful fresh handoff does not delete or consume the source planning session.
Resume it later to inspect or hand off the ready/saved plan again; this deliberate duplication is the recovery path if the destination work is abandoned.
In-memory sessions create an unlinked fresh session because no parent file exists.
Escape, Ctrl+C, menu disposal, source replacement/shutdown, model/auth failure, or cancellation by another extension before replacement leaves the source plan unchanged.
Under **Off — conversation history only**, the destination receives the complete plan in its initial user prompt and does not persist active-plan state.
If that kickoff fails, the complete request remains in the destination editor and the source remains resumable.
Under either guaranteed-plan policy, the destination persists active-plan state before kickoff.
If guaranteed-plan persistence fails, the complete request is placed in the destination editor and the source remains resumable.
If a guaranteed-plan kickoff fails, the destination retains the active plan; send a message to continue, use `/plan exit` to clear it, or resume the parent planning session.

A saved plan appears as `plan saved` and remains available after reload, resume, branch-local fork, and compaction in that session.
It does not expire automatically, cross into a new session, or participate in ordinary model context.
Open `/plan` to Show, Implement here, Start fresh and implement, Export, open Settings, or Clear it; `/plan show`, `/plan implement`, `/plan export [path]`, and `/plan exit`/`off` retain their direct routes in TUI and RPC.
Fresh implementation checks idle state, the selected model, and authentication before session replacement; Implement here keeps its established preflight behavior.
Starting another workflow with `/plan start`, `/plan <prompt>`, or `/plan tools` is blocked until the saved plan is implemented or cleared, so the single saved slot is never silently overwritten.
Resuming that session keeps the plan saved; open `/plan` to review, implement, export, or clear it.
Cancellation or failed implementation preflight leaves it unchanged.

Text print and JSON modes cannot display the bare `/plan` menu and reject that route before changing state; use `/plan start` for direct no-prompt activation or `/plan <prompt>` to start planning with a prompt.
`/plan tools` also rejects before changing state because its staged selector requires TUI or RPC.
These modes can export any stored plan with `/plan export [path]`, save a ready plan with `/plan save`, and clear it with `/plan exit` or `/plan off`.
Successful export is observable through the created file; exporting a ready plan also leaves Plan mode, while saved and active implementation state remains unchanged.
An existing target or missing plan fails the command without changing state.
These modes reject saved-plan display and implementation before changing state because Pi provides neither printable custom-message output nor acknowledged extension-triggered turns; resume the session in TUI or RPC to show or implement it.

Both implementation paths apply the current **Plan reinjection** policy in their destination.
The default **Off — conversation history only** policy does not create active-plan state or inject a hidden plan context.
Implement here sends `Implement the plan.` and leaves the accepted plan in ordinary planning history.
Start fresh and implement, or implementing a saved plan here, puts the complete plan in one ordinary initial user prompt because no reliable planning conversation is present.
Later model calls then rely on Pi's normal conversation history and compaction behavior.
**Through first implementation run** guarantees the exact plan throughout that run, including retries, compaction retries, and queued continuation, then clears active-plan state at `agent_settled`.
**Until manually cleared** guarantees the exact plan across later turns, resume, and manual or automatic compaction until `/plan exit` or supersession.
The guaranteed policies avoid a duplicate context block while the original implementation handoff remains available and inject one hidden canonical copy after that handoff is compacted away.
Reinjection can consume up to the existing 50,000-character plan limit in model context.
Cleanup is bound to the matching implementation, so an older run settling cannot clear a newer handoff.

While a guaranteed plan is active, `/plan show` displays the accepted plan.
Interactive `/plan` offers Show, Export plan…, Settings, Start a new plan, and Clear; `/plan exit` and `/plan off` are the direct clear routes.
Settings changes never alter the policy already captured by an active guaranteed-plan implementation.
Automatic first-run cleanup removes the active status and future injected context after the triggering implementation run has received the complete plan.
Starting a new Plan-mode workflow or implementing a replacement plan supersedes an active guaranteed plan.
The extension deliberately does not infer completion from assistant prose or agent settlement under **Until manually cleared**, so clear the active plan when it no longer applies.
Under **Off — conversation history only**, implementation messages remain ordinary conversation history and there is no active plan for `/plan exit` to remove.
Choosing Stay before implementation keeps the plan ready.
Revision feedback starts another Plan-mode turn and clears the previous implementable plan until an updated completion arrives.
For clarification-only follow-ups, the agent answers and resubmits the complete unchanged plan so it remains implementable.
Before saving or implementation, exit/off discards the ready plan and removes its completion result from later non-Plan model context.

While Plan mode is enabled, the extension also publishes a compact status for Pi statuslines.
With `@narumitw/pi-statusline`, this appears in the extension status area:

- `plan active`: Plan mode is enabled and still gathering context or drafting a plan.
- `plan ready`: A completed plan is stored until you implement it, export it, save it, continue planning, or exit Plan mode.
- `plan saved`: One completed plan is stored outside model context in the current session until you implement or clear it.
- `plan implementing`: The exact accepted plan is guaranteed under **Through first implementation run** or **Until manually cleared**.

You can also exit directly.
Before implementation, direct exit discards the latest proposed plan; while a plan is saved, it clears that saved plan.
During a guaranteed-plan implementation, it removes both the original implementation handoff and the extension's canonical active-plan block from later model calls; an earlier Pi-generated compaction summary may still describe prior work:

```text
/plan exit
```

## 🤝 Workflow coexistence

Plan mode is independently installable and keeps its standalone behavior when no other protocol participant is present.
On the characterized Pi `0.84.2` runtime, it participates in the anonymous `workflow:mutex:v1` `agent-workflow` group.
It holds the group while Planning is active, while a completed plan awaits review, and while revision is underway.
Saved plans and ordinary implementation after Plan handoff do not hold the group.

Every inactive start performs one final synchronous admission after asynchronous preflight and before changing Plan state, persistence, prompts, tools, thinking level, queues, or status.
If another participant is active, TUI and RPC show an anonymous warning that another workflow is active.
Print and JSON direct routes throw the same anonymous error before mutation.
Launch-menu, selected-tool, shortcut, active-implementation **Start a new plan**, and restored activation use the same admission boundary.
A rejected selected-tool launch does not save its draft choices.

Restored active Plan state acquires before restoring restrictive tools, thinking, status, or model hooks.
If restoration is busy, Plan mode stays non-running, leaves persisted history and active tools untouched, and requires a later reload or explicit new start after the other workflow ends.
Planning-session cancellation during a fresh implementation preflight keeps the source Plan and its ownership.
Successful session replacement relies on source-session shutdown to clean up and release; the destination's ordinary active implementation does not acquire the Plan mutex.

The coexistence guarantee is cooperative and applies only when every contender implements v1 on the characterized Pi runtime and shares its event bus and session-manager identity.
A pre-v1, mixed-version, non-participating, forked, or otherwise uncharacterized counterpart remains unsupported for mutual exclusion.
Plan mode does not identify, inspect, configure, start, stop, or depend on another extension.
Guaranteed coexistence with Goal requires `@narumitw/pi-goal` `0.53.0` or newer and this package at `0.52.0` or newer on the characterized Pi `0.84.2` runtime.

| Installation | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Plan mode without another workflow participant | Supported standalone behavior |
| Plan mode `>=0.52.0` with Goal `>=0.53.0` on Pi `0.84.2` | Workflow Mutex v1 coexistence guarantee |
| Either package below its floor, or another Pi runtime | Standalone behavior only; mutual exclusion unsupported |

## 🛠️ Tools

- `plan_mode_question` asks up to three structured questions, supports optional answer notes, submits one answer directly, and reviews multiple answers before TUI submission.
- `plan_mode_complete` records the complete approved Markdown plan and terminates the planning turn when called alone.

## ⚙️ Settings

Open **Settings** from an inactive `/plan` menu to edit one flat group of six workflow choices: **Plan thinking**, **Plan policy tools**, **Plan reinjection**, **Export destination**, **Plan mode shortcut**, and **Plan tools**.
You can also edit `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/pi-plan-mode.json` (normally `~/.pi/agent/pi-plan-mode.json`) manually.
`safeSubcommands` remains JSON-only.
You can change the Plan-mode shortcut with `toggleShortcut` as long as the file remains JSON-only and uses a valid key string.
The file is optional, is read at session start and reloaded automatically when changed, and is created only after an explicit Settings save or manual edit.
When omitted, the shortcut is disabled by default.
```json
{
  "thinkingLevel": "inherit",
  "toolVisibility": "after-first-plan",
  "defaultPlanTools": ["read", "bash", "grep", "find", "ls"],
  "implementationPlanRetention": "clear-on-start",
  "defaultPlanExportPath": "PLAN.md",
  "safeSubcommands": {
    "git": ["status", "log", "rev-parse", "blame"],
    "gh": ["pr view", "pr list", "issue view", "issue list"]
  },
  "toggleShortcut": "<your_key>"
}
```

### Plan helper visibility

`toolVisibility` accepts `"after-first-plan"` or `"always"`.
Omit it—or choose **After first plan**—to keep both Plan helpers out of model requests until the first successful Plan activation in that extension runtime.
A successful activation keeps the helpers visible for the rest of that runtime; changing the setting back to **After first plan** while inactive resets and hides them at an idle, mutex-admitted boundary.
Choose **Always** to make the helpers model-visible at session startup and avoid the lazy first-use prefix change.
Settings-menu changes apply and persist immediately only after idle and Workflow Mutex admission; failure restores the prior runtime and displayed value.
Manual file changes reload automatically and apply visibility when the session is inactive, idle, and mutex-admitted.
An unsafe manual reload keeps the current tool envelope until the next session start or successful Plan activation.
A restored active Plan reveals its helpers only after acquiring workflow ownership, while a busy restore leaves active tools untouched.
This setting uses ordinary active-tool activation and does not claim Pi native deferred loading.

### Default Plan policy tools

`defaultPlanTools` defines the initial runtime allowlist when a session has no stored pre-start selection.
Omit it—or choose **Use automatic safe built-ins**—to allow already-active safe built-ins by default.
An explicit empty array appears as **No optional tools** and denies every ordinary tool while the required helpers remain callable in Plan mode.
Neither setting changes model-visible tool schemas.

Tool names must be non-empty strings; duplicates are removed in first-seen order.
Unknown, inactive, and Plan-mode-blocked names are unavailable to the policy and never become active merely by entering Plan mode.
Settings retains configured inactive names and shows them as unavailable; resetting to automatic removes the entire override.
An ordinary tool registered or activated after the startup baseline is outside the current workflow policy; start a later session to include it in the selectable baseline.
Non-built-in names in this global setting are an explicit user-risk opt-in, just like selecting them in the pre-start workflow selector.
Plan mode does not interpret a selected custom tool's arguments or actions: allowing one trusts the whole effective tool.
Pi resolves tools by name, so if an extension overrides a built-in name, the effective extension tool is selected instead.
An effective active tool named `bash` remains subject to the limited-shell policy regardless of its source metadata.

A selection accepted through **Choose tools, then start…** or `/plan tools` is stored in that Pi session and takes precedence over `defaultPlanTools` when the session resumes.
The global setting remains the policy baseline for fresh sessions and sessions without an explicit selection.
Settings saves immediately, but saved policy names and thinking apply only when a later Plan workflow starts; they never mutate active schemas or a workflow already in progress.

### Plan reinjection

The stable JSON field `implementationPlanRetention` controls whether and how long the `context` hook restores the exact approved plan when ordinary model context no longer contains it.
Omit it or use `clear-on-start` for **Off — conversation history only**, the default Codex-like behavior with no active-plan state or hidden context injection.
In the planning session, this policy sends `Implement the plan.` and relies on the accepted plan already present in ordinary conversation history.
A fresh session or saved-plan implementation instead places the complete plan in one ordinary kickoff prompt because its planning history is unavailable or intentionally excluded.
Use `clear-after-first-run` for **Through first implementation run** to guarantee the exact plan until that implementation's first fully settled run ends.
Use `keep` for **Until manually cleared** to guarantee and reinject the exact plan until `/plan exit` or supersession.
A resumed guaranteed-plan cleanup policy re-arms against the first context in the replacement session.
Failed handoff delivery restores the ready or saved plan and does not run automatic cleanup.

Changing this setting applies to the next Implement action only.
Each guaranteed-plan implementation stores its effective policy, so a later Settings save cannot shorten or extend an implementation already in progress.
Conversation-history-only implementation has no active Plan-mode state to show, export, or clear after kickoff.

### Export destination

`defaultPlanExportPath` controls only exports that omit a path.
Omit it—or submit an empty value in Settings—to use `PLAN.md`.
The value must be a non-empty string of at most 4,096 characters without terminal control characters or NUL.
Relative values are resolved against the current working directory at export time; the Settings detail and every export input preview the concrete resolved destination.
An explicit `/plan export <path>` is a one-off override and does not edit Settings.
Saving a new destination affects the next export immediately, including export of a currently active implementation.

The existing no-overwrite, cancellation, and atomic Plan-state behavior is unchanged.
A failed save rolls the row back to its previous value; a failed or cancelled export preserves the plan and target.
Long previews wrap or truncate to the available terminal width without changing the raw path used by the action.

### Toggle shortcut

`toggleShortcut` controls the global Plan-mode keybinding used by the TUI shortcut.
Omit this setting to keep the shortcut disabled.
Set `toggleShortcut` to the key string you want.
Avoid values that conflict with editor shortcuts.

### Safe shell subcommands

`safeSubcommands` adds reviewed command validators to limited `bash`; it is not a raw shell allowlist.
Only the following exact values are accepted:

- `git`: `status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, `branch`, `remote`, `ls-files`, `grep`, `rev-parse`, `blame`, `describe`, `merge-base`, `ls-tree`, and `cat-file`.
- `gh`: `pr view`, `pr list`, `issue view`, and `issue list`.

The first eight Git validators are built in and remain enabled when omitted, so listing them is valid but redundant.
The other six Git validators and every `gh` path require an explicit opt-in.
Git entries select one exact subcommand; `gh` entries select one exact two-word path, so `"pr view"` never enables `pr merge`, `pr close`, or `pr edit`.
Omitted `safeSubcommands`, an empty object, and empty arrays preserve the default policy.
Duplicate values are removed in first-seen order.

With the example configuration above, commands such as these are accepted:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git blame -- src/plan-mode.ts
git diff --cached
git show --stat --oneline HEAD
git log -p -1 HEAD -- src/plan-mode.ts
gh pr view 218 --json number,title,state
gh issue list --state open --json number,title,state
```

The command-specific validators still reject unsafe forms, including:

```bash
git blame --textconv -- src/plan-mode.ts
git cat-file --filters HEAD
git diff --ext-diff
git log --show-signature -1
git remote show origin
git show --textconv HEAD
gh pr merge 218
gh pr view 218
gh pr view 218 --web
gh pr view 218 > pr.txt
gh pr list --json number,title && gh pr merge 218
```

Redirects, shell expansion and substitution, explicit pager or browser requests, explicit external diff/textconv/filter/signature helpers, output flags, malformed command layouts, and any chain containing an unsafe segment fail closed.
Read-dominant Git validators accept ordinary inspection flags without requiring `--no-textconv` or `--no-ext-diff`; Git may therefore invoke a helper configured by the user or trusted repository even when the command does not request one explicitly.
Use the negative flags when you want to suppress those configured helpers.
Mixed read/write surfaces remain narrower: use `git remote show -n` to avoid invoking a transport helper, while mutating `branch` and `remote` forms remain blocked.
GitHub CLI read paths require `--json <fields>` output so Plan mode does not rely on `GH_PAGER`, `PAGER`, or gh pager configuration.
Unknown `safeSubcommands` keys or values, non-array values, and non-string entries invalidate the entire settings file and trigger the normal warning/default fallback on session start.

Read-only does not mean private: Git inspection can expose repository history and tracked secrets, while `gh` queries can expose remote repository, pull request, and issue data available to your authenticated account.
The policy reduces accidental mutation and explicit helper execution; it is not a sandbox or a confidentiality boundary.

### Thinking level

Plan mode inherits Pi's current thinking level by default.
Set `thinkingLevel` to request a fixed level only while Plan mode is active.
Supported values are `inherit`, `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`.
The extension snapshots the prior level and restores it on exit only if the level still matches the value it applied; a manual change made during Plan mode is preserved.
A Settings save does not change Pi's current or default thinking level and takes effect only when the next Plan workflow starts.

Settings saves are serialized in invocation order inside one Pi process.
Each save re-reads the latest valid document, preserves unknown top-level fields and unedited `safeSubcommands`, then publishes through a same-directory temporary file and rename.
A missing file stays absent until an explicit save.
Invalid JSON, invalid values, oversized content, non-regular files, and read failures make Settings read-only; the existing bytes and previous effective settings remain.
This in-process queue is not a cross-process lock, so concurrent separate Pi processes can still race.

Invalid settings produce a warning and fall back to inherited thinking, `after-first-plan` helper visibility, available safe-built-in tool defaults, `clear-on-start`, and `PLAN.md`.
Compatibility: a valid legacy `plan-mode.json` remains readable with a warning and is never modified automatically.
If Settings is explicitly saved while only that legacy file exists, the extension creates canonical `pi-plan-mode.json` from the complete legacy document, applies the selected change, preserves unknown fields, and leaves the legacy file untouched.
If both files exist, the canonical filename takes precedence.

## 🧠 Codex-like behavior

This extension maps Codex's `ModeKind::Plan` behavior onto Pi's extension API:

- Plan mode is a conversational collaboration mode, not TODO/progress tracking.
- `/plan <prompt>` follows Codex behavior by switching to Plan mode before submitting the inline prompt.
- The agent should use `plan_mode_question` for important non-discoverable preferences or tradeoffs before finalizing.
- The agent completes with a standalone `plan_mode_complete` tool call instead of relying on semantic prose detection.
- `update_plan` checklist use is blocked while Plan mode is active.
- The implementation boundary is explicit: Plan mode appends the Normal contract and lifts its runtime allowlist before saving or starting implementation, while revealed helpers remain active.
- The default `clear-on-start` policy follows Codex by using ordinary conversation history only; `clear-after-first-run` and `keep` add explicit exact-plan guarantees.
- Pi extension safety is approximated with tool classification and fail-closed filtering for every effective tool named `bash`; other non-built-in tools remain user-selected at user risk because Pi does not expose standardized tool mutability metadata.
- Plan and Normal instructions are append-only conversation contracts; **Always** keeps tool schemas stable from startup, while **After first plan** intentionally changes the helper schema and prompt-metadata prefix once before keeping it stable.
- Unlike native Codex, this extension uses a terminating Pi tool plus an `agent_settled` ready flow; Pi cannot provide sandbox-level enforcement.

`index.ts` is the Pi entrypoint and forwards to `plan-mode.ts`; the other source modules are internal.
The package exposes its Pi extension through `package.json`:

```json
{
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./dist/index.ts"]
  }
}
```

The generated runtime is built from the authoritative `src/index.ts` graph and does not import back into `src`.
