# 📊 pi-usage — Check Provider Usage and Codex Fast Mode

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@narumitw/pi-usage)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@narumitw/pi-usage) [![Pi extension](https://img.shields.io/badge/Pi-extension-blue)](https://pi.dev) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)](./LICENSE)

Check the limits and usage for the provider account Pi is actually using, and toggle Fast mode for supported OpenAI Codex models.

The extension reports each provider's native semantics instead of presenting unlike quotas as equivalent.

## ✨ Features

- Shows current-account usage and next actions through `/usage`.
- Supports OpenAI Codex subscription windows, credits, resets, and model-specific buckets.
- Supports GitHub Copilot allowances and OpenRouter per-key limits and spend windows.
- Toggles persistent Codex Fast routing through `/fast` or the contextual usage menu.
- Redeems eligible Codex resets only after fresh account matching and explicit confirmation.
- Refreshes one or all configured providers with bounded concurrency and partial-result preservation.
- Keeps statusline and cache data scoped to the current provider and runtime account.
- Resolves credentials through Pi and validates the effective provider endpoint before sending them.

## 📦 Install

Requires Pi 0.81.0 or newer so the extension can validate the effective base URL attached to resolved provider auth before sending credentials to an official usage endpoint.

```bash
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-usage
```

Try without installing permanently:

```bash
pi -e npm:@narumitw/pi-usage
```

Build and try this package locally from the repository root:

```bash
npm --workspace @narumitw/pi-usage run build
pi -e ./packages/pi-usage
```

The package declares `dist/index.ts`, so an unbuilt local checkout must run the build before Pi loads the package directory.

## 🚀 Quick start

Run `/usage` in TUI or RPC mode to inspect the current provider, refresh usage, or choose another configured provider.
Use `/fast` separately to toggle Fast mode for a supported current Codex model.

## 💬 Commands

Run:

```text
/usage
```

In TUI or RPC mode, the standard menu first queries the current model provider and presents its state with these actions:

```text
Refresh current usage
Turn Fast mode on/off       # Supported current Codex models only
Redeem usage limit reset…   # Current Codex OAuth accounts only
View another configured provider…
View all configured providers…
Close
```

There are intentionally no `/usage --refresh`, `/usage <provider>`, or `/usage --all` argument paths.
Cross-provider traffic requires an explicit interactive choice.
Escape returns from provider selection and closes the root menu.
Print and JSON modes reject `/usage` observably because they cannot host the interactive flow.
The cancellable live-query progress view remains extension-owned because it streams provider work and supports in-flight abort rather than presenting a standard menu screen.

For the current OpenAI Codex provider, **Redeem usage limit reset…** checks fresh earned-reset details, lets you select a reset when details are available, and shows the exact reset before asking for confirmation.
**No, go back** is the safe default and cancellation before confirmation sends no mutation.
After confirmation, the reset operation cannot be cancelled from its progress view; session replacement or shutdown still aborts owned work.
A transport failure offers **Try again** with the same redemption request ID so the backend can treat an uncertain retry idempotently.
Successful, already-completed, not-needed, and no-credit outcomes are reported separately, then usage and the statusline are refreshed for the still-current account.

## ⚙️ Settings

### Codex Fast mode

Run bare `/fast` to toggle Fast for the active supported Codex model, or use **Turn Fast mode on/off** in `/usage`.

Fast is about 1.5× faster and uses more of your plan allowance.
The preference defaults to Off and is saved as `codexFastMode` in Pi's user agent directory as `pi-usage.json`, normally `~/.pi/agent/pi-usage.json`.
The extension reloads this file at every session start and does not create it until the first successful toggle.

Fast currently applies only to official `openai-codex-responses` requests for `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.5`, `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, and `gpt-5.6-luna` at `https://chatgpt.com`.
It sends `service_tier: "priority"` while enabled and explicit `service_tier: "default"` otherwise.
The statusline adds `fast` only while the preference is effective, for example `codex fast 59% 5h`.
Unsupported models and custom or proxy origins are left unchanged.

`/fast` supports TUI and RPC mode, accepts no arguments, and rejects print or JSON mode before mutation.
A toggle affects provider requests whose payload hook starts after the save; a request already sent is unchanged.
Settings operations are serialized inside one Pi process, but separate Pi processes are not mutually locked.
Unknown JSON fields are preserved, writes use a private temporary file plus rename, and a malformed or invalid file is never overwritten.
Repair or remove an invalid file, then run `/reload` before trying the toggle again.

## 📋 Provider semantics

### OpenAI Codex

- Provider ID: `openai-codex`
- Semantics: ChatGPT consumer subscription limits
- Source: the Codex usage and earned-reset endpoints using Pi's resolved runtime authorization
- Displayed data: returned duration-based windows, resets, credits, earned usage-limit resets, and additional model buckets
- Reset mutation: `POST /wham/rate-limit-reset-credits/consume` with a unique redemption request ID and, when available, the selected opaque credit ID
- Statusline examples: `codex 59% 5h 61% wk`, `codex fast 59% 5h`, or `codex spark 100% 5h`

The statusline selects a returned bucket that matches the current Codex model when one is available.
Unlike `pi-codex-usage`, this successor intentionally has no Codex CLI fallback because the CLI may be logged into a different account than Pi's active runtime account.

Reset redemption is available only when Codex is the current provider and Pi's freshly resolved access token exactly matches its stored OpenAI Codex OAuth credential.
`pi-usage` forwards only the bearer authorization and matching `chatgpt-account-id` to the official ChatGPT origin.
API-key credentials, configured-but-not-current Codex accounts, account changes during the flow, and custom/proxy origins fail before mutation.
Backend-provided titles and descriptions are sanitized for terminal display.
Opaque credit and account IDs are never shown or persisted by the extension.

### GitHub Copilot

- Provider ID: `github-copilot`
- Semantics: the allowance reported for the active Copilot plan—AI credits for current usage-based billing, premium requests for legacy annual billing, or chat requests for Copilot Free's limited response shape
- Source: GitHub's undocumented `GET /copilot_internal/user` endpoint
- Displayed data: entitlement, remaining allowance, percentage, reset time, plan, and any additional usage beyond the included allowance
- Statusline examples: `copilot credits 1200/1500 80%`, `copilot 245/300 82%`, or `copilot chat 40/50 80%`

GitHub's quota endpoint requires the original GitHub OAuth token rather than the short-lived Copilot inference token exposed by runtime auth.
`pi-usage` therefore supports Copilot accounts created through Pi's `/login` flow, reads that stored credential through Pi's public API, and uses it only when its short-lived access token matches the active runtime credential.
API-key credentials, account mismatches, GitHub Enterprise accounts, and proxy/custom provider origins fail closed.
The detailed report follows the endpoint's `token_based_billing` marker so AI credits are not mislabeled as legacy premium requests, and it reports overage without treating a negative included balance as a malformed response.

### OpenRouter

- Provider ID: `openrouter`
- Semantics: API-key spend and per-key credit limits—not consumer subscription quota
- Source: OpenRouter's documented [`GET /api/v1/key`](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api/api-reference/api-keys/get-current-api-key) endpoint using Pi's resolved inference API key
- Displayed data: key label when safely returned, optional per-key limit and remaining amount, reset period, and daily/weekly/monthly/all-time spend
- Statusline examples: `openrouter $74.50 left` or `openrouter $25.50 used`

The extension does not call OpenRouter's account-level `/credits` endpoint because that operation requires a separate management key.
OpenRouter documents the distinction between credit and rate limits in its [API limits guide](https://openrouter.ai/docs/api_reference/limits).

### OpenCode Go (Zen)

- Provider ID: `opencode-go`
- Semantics: OpenCode Zen plan usage windows—rolling, weekly, and monthly
- Source: `GET {model base URL}/usage` on the configured `opencode.ai` gateway using Pi's resolved inference API key
- Displayed data: used percentage and reset time for each window; `rate-limited` windows remain visible at their reported usage, while unknown statuses are reported as unavailable notes
- Statusline examples: `zen 0% r 4% w 2% m`

The usage endpoint is derived from the model's base URL (`…/zen/go/v1/usage`) and is only queried when the resolved origin is `https://opencode.ai`; other origins fail before sending the credential.

## 🧭 Current and configured accounts

`Current` means the provider and credential used by Pi's selected model.
`Configured` means Pi reports runtime auth for another supported provider; it does not mean that provider is active.

The extension does not enumerate multiple accounts inside one provider and does not switch accounts.
Account selection remains owned by Pi or an account-management extension.
After the active runtime credential changes, the next command, turn, or scheduled refresh resolves auth again and cannot reuse another account's cached report.

## 📊 Statusline behavior

The `usage` status item is active only for the selected model provider.
It refreshes every five minutes while the session remains on a supported provider and is cleared when the model changes to an unsupported provider.

Manual another-provider and all-provider queries never publish to the statusline.
`@narumitw/pi-statusline` supplies the default `📊` icon; `pi-usage` publishes text-only values.

## 🔄 Migrating from pi-codex-usage

`pi-codex-usage` is deprecated and its source is archived under `deprecated/`.
To migrate one installation:

```bash
pi remove npm:@narumitw/pi-codex-usage
pi install npm:@narumitw/pi-usage
```

Remove the deprecated package rather than loading both usage extensions together.

Behavior changes:

- Use `/usage` for usage management; `/codex-status` is no longer registered.
- Refresh and cross-provider operations are menu actions rather than flags.
- Codex CLI fallback is removed to preserve active-runtime-account correctness.
- The status key changes from `codex-usage` to `usage`.

## 🚧 Limitations

- Only providers with a meaningful usage source and verifiable Pi runtime auth are supported.
- GitHub Copilot quota and OpenAI Codex reset redemption use undocumented provider endpoints that may change without notice.
- Codex reset redemption requires a current ChatGPT OAuth login created through Pi; Codex API keys cannot redeem earned subscription resets.
- Credentials resolved for custom provider base URLs are never forwarded to the providers' official usage endpoints; effective auth origin validation requires Pi 0.81.0 or newer.
- Provider reports are snapshots and may themselves be delayed by the provider.
- OpenRouter successful inference responses do not expose proactive request-rate counters; `/usage` reports the documented per-key credit/spend fields instead.
- A provider may not return a safe human-readable account identity.
  In that case the provider and runtime credential state remain visible without exposing secrets.
- Immediate account-change events are not available from Pi; auth is re-resolved before commands, turns, and scheduled refreshes.
- Fast model support is intentionally conservative and may require an extension update when Codex adds or removes service tiers.
- Another later-loaded extension can replace the final provider payload, so arbitrary third-party payload-rewrite conflicts cannot be prevented.

`index.ts` is the Pi entrypoint and forwards the default factory from `usage.ts` while retaining the package's named helper exports; other source modules are internal.

The generated runtime is built from the authoritative `src/index.ts` graph and does not import back into `src`.
