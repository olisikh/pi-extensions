# pi-goal interruption and continuation lifecycle

This note records the current lifecycle contract behind `@narumitw/pi-goal`. It explains why Goal
continuation waits for Pi's settled boundary, how retry and compaction ownership is retained, and
which races cannot be eliminated by an extension.

## Scope and authority

The maintained implementation and tests are authoritative:

- `packages/pi-goal/src/goal.ts`
- `packages/pi-goal/src/runtime.ts`
- `packages/pi-goal/src/accounting.ts`
- `packages/pi-goal/src/safety.ts`
- `packages/pi-goal/src/prompts.ts`
- `packages/pi-goal/src/goal-contract.ts`
- `packages/pi-goal/src/workflow-mutex.ts`
- `packages/pi-goal/test/goal.test.ts`
- `packages/pi-goal/test/goal-cache-contract.test.ts`
- `test/plan-goal-coexistence.test.ts`
- `packages/pi-goal/test/goal-runtime-smoke.mjs`

The package README owns the public command, settings, status, and interruption contract. This note
keeps only the internal lifecycle rationale and remaining Pi-core boundary.

## Settled continuation contract

`pi-goal` separates outcome classification from continuation dispatch:

1. `turn_end` accounts every completed model response owned by automatic Goal work and enforces an
   optional configured response cap.
2. `agent_end` records final usage, classifies the run outcome, applies the no-progress guard, and
   creates an in-memory continuation intent for an eligible active goal. It does not send the normal
   continuation.
3. `agent_settled` runs after retry, automatic compaction, steering, and follow-up work drains. It
   first finalizes matching exhausted recovery, then may dispatch an ordinary continuation.
4. Continuation dispatch re-reads the active goal, requires matching ownership, `ctx.isIdle()`, and
   no pending messages. Repeated settled events cannot consume one intent twice.

Standalone manual compaction does not emit `agent_settled`, so `session_compact` invokes the same
single-flight idle dispatcher as a narrow fallback. It does not introduce a second continuation
path or bypass the idle and pending-message gates.

## Ownership and stale-delivery protection

Goal-owned kickoff, resume, active-edit, and continuation prompts carry bounded markers tied to the
originating goal id. Continuation tickets also include the goal iteration and a unique nonce. Intent
and accepted delivery are tracked separately so cancellation can cover both a not-yet-dispatched
continuation and a prompt that was accepted by Pi but lost the non-atomic start race.

At `input`, `before_agent_start`, and later lifecycle boundaries, the runtime revalidates the active
goal id, prompt marker, status, and run ownership before mutating state. Session replacement
separately clears pending prompt, continuation, recovery, and run ownership. A newer user or extension
turn can supersede old continuation intent. A delayed prompt from a replaced, stopped, cleared, or
completed goal cannot reactivate work or overwrite a newer goal.

Pi extensions cannot atomically reserve an idle turn. Another extension can still win after
`ctx.isIdle()` and pending-message checks. Goal markers, start-boundary revalidation, and later fresh
intent recovery bound this race, but do not provide the runtime-owned idle reservation available to
Pi core.

Goal also participates independently in the anonymous `workflow:mutex:v1` protocol.
An active or waiting Goal retains cooperative ownership across normal work, continuation delivery, compaction, and provider recovery.
Admission rejects another cooperating workflow before Goal state, tools, persistence, prompts, status, or timers change.
The mutex does not reserve a Pi turn and cannot coordinate trusted extensions that do not participate in the protocol.

## Retry, compaction, and stopped states

Retryable provider failures and context-overflow compaction remain Pi-owned recovery:

- `agent_end` keeps the matching goal active, cancels ordinary continuation pressure, and records
  recovery ownership instead of blocking retry tools.
- A retry or compaction start consumes or carries that ownership into the replacement run so
  automatic accounting cannot be bypassed.
- If matching recovery remains when `agent_settled` proves no retry, compaction, or follow-up is
  pending, the goal becomes `blocked`.
- Explicit subscription, quota, credit, or billing exhaustion becomes `usage_limited`; transient
  rate limits and server failures remain retryable.
- User interruption becomes `paused`. Other terminal non-usage failures become `blocked`.

Stopped transitions cancel current continuation ownership and block stale Goal-owned tool calls.
Successful resume rotates the goal id and starts a fresh blocker and safety audit. Clear removes Goal
state and stale guards without aborting unrelated work.

## Compaction persistence

Canonical Goal state is stored in `goal-state` session entries. Before compaction, the runtime
checkpoints active elapsed time and current safety/accounting state. Automatic compaction retries do
not enqueue another Goal turn. Non-retrying manual compaction creates at most one fresh intent and
uses the common idle dispatcher. Old queue metadata in `goal-state` or legacy `goals-state` entries
is treated as inert legacy data and never dispatches automatic work.

Goal prompts and compacted context use the same objective trust boundary, stale goal id, full-scope rule, and requirement-by-requirement completion audit.
The runtime constructs one versioned hidden `goal-contract` message at a fixed `context` hook boundary after leading summaries.
It restores Goal instructions when persisted active state has no retained handoff and keeps mutable accounting out of the leading provider prompt prefix.
Prompt wording is a guardrail; current files, commands, tests, runtime behavior, and external state remain the completion evidence.

## Usage, elapsed time, and circuit breakers

For each persisted assistant message, accounting prefers a finite non-negative
`usage.totalTokens`. Older or partial records fall back to finite non-negative
`input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`, without adding fields already included in those totals.
Goal usage subtracts the branch baseline captured at activation and clamps branch rewinds at zero.

`tool_execution_end` is the earliest reliable in-turn budget boundary because Pi persists the
assistant message before this hook. It can transition once to `budget_limited` and inject one bounded
wrap-up instruction; `agent_end` is the no-tool fallback. Active elapsed time is accumulated only
while status is `active`, excluding stopped, shutdown, and offline periods.

Automatic-work safety is separate from the token budget:

- `continuationLimits.automaticTurns` defaults to `25`; explicit `null` selects Unlimited, and `turn_end` counts normal responses from automatic continuations, including tool loops and matching recovery work.
- `continuationLimits.noProgressTurns` defaults to `3`. Repeated empty or normalized-identical
  tool-free automatic runs pause the goal; attempted tool calls reset that heuristic.
- The no-progress fingerprint is fixed-size and stores no raw assistant text.
- Safety state persists across reload and compaction. It resets only at documented successful
  user-control boundaries.

These guards pause rather than infer completion. `goal_complete` remains authoritative because plain
assistant text cannot prove filesystem, test, runtime, PR, rendered, or external requirements.

## Remaining Pi-core boundary

The extension deliberately does not claim Codex-style runtime ownership that Pi does not expose:

- no atomic idle-turn reservation;
- no hidden runtime input that is distinct from normal message delivery;
- no first-class Goal-aware abort event or queue priority;
- no global scheduler coordinating Goal continuation with every extension.

The current design uses public lifecycle hooks and bounded ownership markers. Moving continuation
into Pi core could remove the residual idle race, but is not required for the extension's current
settled, retry, compaction, accounting, and stale-delivery guarantees.

## Verification map

  races: `packages/pi-goal/test/goal.test.ts` settled-continuation cases.
- Workflow Mutex acquisition, rejection before mutation, restore fallbacks, load-order independence, release, and reacquisition: `test/plan-goal-coexistence.test.ts` and `test/workflow-mutex-runtime.test.ts`.

- Usage totals, active time, tool-boundary budgets, wrap-up ownership, and safety epochs: accounting,
  budget, and automatic-turn cases in `goal.test.ts`, plus persistence/settings tests.
- Real Pi event ordering, retries, manual compaction, no-progress stopping, automatic tool loops, and
  bounded pre-aborted cleanup: `packages/pi-goal/test/goal-runtime-smoke.mjs`.
